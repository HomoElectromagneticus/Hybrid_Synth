FPGA Synth Notes

>	how fast must the DACs be multiplexed?
    It looks like you would need to multiplex them at ~5MHz to be on the safe 
    side, which means that the bus will be "holding" for only 200ns. Luckily, 
    most parallel-input DACs only need 55ns for setup and hold on thier digital
    inputs
    
    The now-ancient AD7545 from the original PPG synthesizers needed hundreds 
    of nanosecondss of setup-and-hold time. This limitation is likely part of 
    the reasons that the original PPG synthesizers "skipped" samples to achieve
    higher pitches.
    
    Given all of this, dropping some samples is still necessary in order to keep
    the bus speed to reasonable speeds.

    "sample skipping" regions?

>	how should the FPGA running the NCOs and the DAC input bus be interfaced
    with? a microcontroller seems like a natural choice, but the input to each
    NCO is 28 bits! perhaps packing a serial-to-parallel interface and wide MUX
    into the FGPA is the way to go...

    envolopes and such, just like the old polysynths of yore used to do (single
    CV DAC with a multiplexer and many hold capacitors)

    Otherwise, the sample-to-sample amplitude difference might be so great as 
    to produce an unwanted "click" or "thump" in the audio.
