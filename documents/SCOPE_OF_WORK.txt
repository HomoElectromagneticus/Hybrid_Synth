Project Overview =============================================================

The goal of this project is to create a polyphonic synthesizer that recreates
the "problems" or "defects" with early digital synthesizers, with the
understanding that these "defects" are the very things that made them great. A 
quick overview of some the "defects" that this project would ideally 
incorporate:

*   Variable Sample-Rate Oscillators
    The digital sample rate of an individual oscillator shall be an integer 
    multiple of the pitch that very oscillator is producing. This means that 
    any aliasing or artifacts in the digital audio path will be harmonically 
    related to the fundamental pitch.

*   Low Bit-Depth in the Digital Oscillator Waveforms
    The oscillator waves shall be relatively low-fidelity. Given that the 
    oscillator sample rate is an integer multiple of the oscillator pitch, 
    the "crunchiness" one associates with low bit-depth audio will be "in-tune" 
    with the oscillator pitch. The acoustic effect here is similar to what one
    might hear from old "exciter" studio effects designed to give a sound more
    upper harmonics.

*   Wavetable Support
    The synthesizer shall support wavetables as implemented on PPG 
    synthesizers. Wavetables allow for oscillators to produce harmonics that
    vary over time. Such time-variant harmonics can either create more natural
    timbres, or allow the instrument to create really unworldly sounds.

Other Project Features ========================================================

*   Analog Filters and Analog VCAs
    Each voice should have its own analog filter and amplifier circuit. A nice
    analog filter can work magic on "crunchy" digital waves. An analog VCA is
    preferred over a digital VCA for audio quality reasons.

*   A Display and Simple User Interface
    A synthesizer is an instrument - it should be simple and intuitive to use.

*   MIDI Interface
    You can't make an electronic instrument without a MIDI interface.

Was This Overview Too Long? Did You Not Read it? ==============================

Here's the short version. Instruments that sound like this:

Are not made any more, very expensive to purchase used, big, heavy, and are
difficult to maintain. Could an entirely software instrument make the same 
sounds? Probably, but then you'd have to be staring at yet another backlit LCD 
screen to use it. Fuck that.
