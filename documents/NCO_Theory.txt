NCO Theory ===================================================================

A Numerically Controlled Oscillator generates a sound by periodically assigning 
digital samples that represent a sound to a DAC. The pitch of the sound is 
determined by how often the NCO assigns a new sample to the DAC. Consider the 
following simple graphic:

	^
  A	|
  M	|                    x
  P	|                  x . x
  L	|                x . . . x
  I	|              x . . . . . x
  T	|x           x . . . . . . . x
  U	|. x       x . . . . . . . . .
  D	|. . x   x . . . . . . . . . .
  E	|. . . x . . . . . . . . . . .

	    WAVESAMPLE NUMBER (HEX)

The graphic represents an audio wave as a series of "wavesamples." A sound is 
played by assigning each wavesample to the DAC one after another. Each sample
is "played" in numerical order; 2 is played after 1, A is played after 9, etc.
When wavesample "F" is output, the next wavesample will be "1." You can think 
of this as looping. How quickly this "loop" is played determines the pitch of 
the sound. The pitch can therefore be defined as:

	Pitch = Rate of Wavesample Advancement [Hz] / Total Wavesamples in the Wave
	
How does an NCO determine when to play the next wavesample? It uses the
overflow or "carry" event of a counter that is incremented by a multiplier and 
a master clock. Assuming a 16-bit counter:

	Rate of Overflow Events = (Clock Rate [Hz] * Multiplier ) / (2^16)
								and
	Rate of Overflow Events = Rate of Wavesample Advancement

If we then assume a wave is represented by 128 digital samples:

	Pitch = ((Clock Rate [Hz] * Multiplier) / (2^16) ) / 128

The master clock rate, counter bit depth, are fixed by the physical form that
implements an NCO, but the Multiplier and number of samples per wave are not.
In practice, it makes life easier to also fix the number of samples per wave.
We're left with only one variable - the Multiplier. By choosing different 
values for the Multiplier, different pitches can be played from the DAC. In 
this way, the oscillator is controlled by a number. Hence the term, Numerically
Controlled Oscillator.

This system works fine for low values of Multiplier relative to the counter bit 
depth, but starts to break down as the Multiplier number grows. For this 
reason, it's better to use as "large" a counter as is reasonable.

Note that implementation performs digital wave playback at a variable sample 
rate. In this case, the sample rate is equal to the pitch multiplied by the
number of samples in the wave being played back. This is a very nice property 
for a digital sound generator to have, because the alias frequencies inherent 
to digital sound generation will all be harmonically related to the fundamental 
of the pitch being played. Consider the following example:

	Pitch = 220Hz
	Number of Wavesamples Per Wave = 128
	
In this case, the sample rate would be 128 * 220 = 28,160Hz. Therefore, 
any harmonic content greater than 14,080Hz (the Nyquist frequency is 
equal to half of the sample rate) would be "folded back" as an alias. So
if our 220Hz pitch wave had some information at the 100th harmonic 
(22,000Hz), this "extra pitch" would appear as 7,920Hz, which is the 
36th harmonic of 220Hz.

This is a tremendous advantage for a musical instrument! What is 
typically considered noise or "bad behavior," in digital-to-analog 
conversion schemes becomes something musical.
